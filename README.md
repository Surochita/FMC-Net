# FMC-Net
Here we have kept 10 Model architectures and weights inside the folder "Model" as described in the paper.

Also kept test samples of the generated results.

The folder "scans" contains slices from CT.

The folder "gt" contains the ground truth of the corresponding CT.

The folder "EFMCPred" contains predicted results from our EFMC architecture.
